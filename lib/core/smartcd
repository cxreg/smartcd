#   ###########
#   # Summary #
#   ###########
#
#   This replacement for bash's built-in cd function gives you the
#   ability to run bash_enter and bash_leave scripts for each of
#   the directories you are traveling between.  The scripts are run
#   in the expected order to the most common root between where you
#   are, and where you're going.  These files reside in a hierarchy
#   under your home directory which mirrors the directories they
#   represent, for example:
#
#       /foo/bar/baz  ->  ~/.smartcd/scripts/foo/bar/baz
#
#   ###############
#   # Basic usage #
#   ###############
#
#       # Install the library
#       make install
#
#       # Add it to your bash init script
#       smartcd setup cd # replaces cd with cd()
#
#       # And it works with pushd/popd too
#       smartcd setup pushd
#       smartcd setup popd
#
#       If you are an "autocd" user, you may want
#       smartcd setup prompt-hook
#
#       # Edit the file to create some commands to run when entering
#       smartcd edit enter
#
#       # Non-interactively
#       echo 'echo "hi!"' | smartcd edit enter
#
#       # Or done manually
#       echo 'echo "hi!"' > ~/.smartcd/scripts/somedir/bash_enter
#
#       # When a shell is started enter scripts will be run from / up to your
#       # current directory.  If you want the inverse to occur as well, having
#       # leave scripts run on shell exit, you'll want to hook the shell's EXIT
#       # trap like this:
#       smartcd setup exit-hook
#
#   This library combines very nicely with varstash to allow
#   you to set per-directory environment variables:
#
#       # bash_enter
#       stash PATH
#       export PATH=/something/extra:$PATH
#
#       # bash_leave
#       unstash PATH
#
#       # or the automagic version, which unstashes for you
#       autostash PATH
#       export PATH=/something/extra:$PATH
#
#   When a script is run by smartcd, it will announce that it has done
#   so unless SMARTCD_QUIET is set.
#
#   ###########
#   # Helpers #
#   ###########
#
#   Some pre-written scripts are provided which implement things that
#   you may find useful.  This system also allows people to distribute
#   and share these independently of the core smartcd distribution.
#
#   Currently the included helpers are 'path', 'history', 'perlbrew',
#   and 'perl-locallib'
#
#       smartcd helper run history localize __PATH__/.history
#
#       smartcd helper run path append __PATH__/bin
#
#       smartcd helper run perlbrew init /path/to/perlbrew/install
#
#       smartcd helper run perl-locallib activate __PATH__/perl5lib
#
#   #############
#   # Templates #
#   #############
#
#   One advanced feature of smartcd is the ability to configure and use
#   templates for your enter and leave scripts.  If you often find yourself
#   creating very similar scripts with only minor differences, templates can
#   help.  This is handled with "smartcd template".
#
#   To create a template based on the current directory, run:
#
#       smartcd template create template_name
#
#   The name can be any arbitrary value, but should be meaningful to you and
#   should not contain special characters.  This will create a new template
#   named what you have chosen, and prepopulate it with the contents from
#   your current bash_enter and bash_leave scripts.  You can then edit the
#   file and save it.  When you install the template, anywhere you inserted
#   the string "__PATH__" will be replaced with the directory being set up.
#
#   To install the template, cd to a destination and run:
#
#       smartcd template install template_name
#
#   The other available commands are:
#
#       smartcd template list
#       smartcd template show <name>
#       smartcd template edit <name>
#       smartcd template delete <name>
#
#   ##############
#   # Backing up #
#   ##############
#
#   You may find it valuable to back up your scripts and templates, either
#   for preventative measures, or to copy your scripts to another machine.
#   In any case, a import and export feature is provided to allow you to
#   archive these files and restore them to a ~/.smartcd folder.
#
#       # Export your scripts
#       smartcd export > my_smartcd_backup
#
#       # Several methods to import them
#       smartcd import my_smartcd_backup
#       cat my_smartcd_backup | smartcd import
#
#   If it happens that the machine you are importing to already has a ~/.smartcd
#   directory with any scripts or templates in it, these files will be moved
#   to a temp folder to avoid any conflict.  You may want to inspect these files
#   by hand if this occurs and put them back in place if necessary.
#
#   ########################
#   # Legacy mode (unsafe) #
#   ########################
#
#   The original version of this library was such that the scripts
#   containing the commands to run were themselves located in the
#   directory which they correspond to, named .bash_enter and
#   .bash_leave:
#
#       /foo/bar/baz  ->  /foo/bar/baz/.bash_enter
#
#   This was deemed unsafe, and the new scheme was adopted.  If you
#   prefer the old system and wish to accept the risk in doing so, you
#   can set SMARTCD_LEGACY=1 to allow the old behavior.  If you do not do
#   so, and a legacy script is found, it will *NOT* be invoked, and
#   instructions for migrating it to the new location will be displayed
#   (unless SMARTCD_QUIET is set).  If you set SMARTCD_AUTOMIGRATE=1 then
#   the migration steps will be executed for you whenever a legacy script
#   is found.
