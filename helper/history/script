# Modify your shell history
#
# Thanks to https://github.com/aaronharnly/dotfiles-public for the idea
#
# Example usage:
#     smartcd helper run history also-read ~/.bash_history
#     smartcd helper run history localize __PATH__/.history
#
# This example will read in your "main" history file first, then use
# a local .history file to read and write to while you are in the current
# and any subdirectories.  You can pass as many filenames to also-read
# as you like.
#
# TODO:
#   - provide a prompt hook function to flush and re-read regularly, to
#     allow sharing of history between terminals to be more predictable
#      - cache mtimes to optimize this
